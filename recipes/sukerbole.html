        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Kneed all ingredients for the dough in a kitchen machine for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a bowl and lightly make a ball out of the dough. Put the dough in the bowl with the top down and flip the dough over, covering all sides with a thin layer of oil</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with cling film and let the dough rise for 1 hour till its volume has doubled</li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients for the filling. Take the dough and pull it into a rectangle, cover with 1/3 of the filling. Fold the dough in 3 and flatten slightly. Repeat this process twice till you run out of filling. Kneed a bit more to ensure the filling is equally spread through the dough.</li>
            <li>Push out the dough into a rectangle with a width slightly smaller than the width of the bread tin. Roll up the dough</li>
            <li>Oil the baking tin with some butter and apply the baking paper.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking paper with a thick layer of melted butter and cover with a decent amount of sugar. Shake the baking tin to ensure all baking paper is covered in sugar.</li>
            <li>Spread 25g of pearl sugar in the baking tin.</li>
            <li>Cover the form with cling film and leave to rise for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven at 200 degrees Celcius (top and bottom heat).</li>
            <li>Brush the dough with beaten egg and cover with sugar.</li>
            <li>Place a cup of water in the bottom of the oven and insert the baking tin.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread during 30 minutes till baked through and nicely browned.</li>
            <li>Leave the bread to rest for 5 minutes before removing it from the baking tin and placing it on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
